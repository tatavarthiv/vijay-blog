# TypeScript Tips Every Developer Should Know

TypeScript has become an essential tool for modern web development. Here are some tips to help you get the most out of it.

## Tip 1: Use Type Guards

Type guards help you narrow down types safely:

```typescript
function isString(value: unknown): value is string {
  return typeof value === "string";
}
```

## Tip 2: Leverage Union Types

Union types provide flexibility while maintaining type safety:

```typescript
type Status = "loading" | "success" | "error";
```
