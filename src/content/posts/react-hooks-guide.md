# Complete Guide to React Hooks

React hooks revolutionized how we write React components. Let's explore the most important ones.

## useState Hook

The most basic hook for managing state:

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

## useEffect Hook

For side effects and lifecycle management:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Effect logic here
}, [dependencies]);
```

## Custom Hooks

Create reusable logic with custom hooks:

```javascript
function useCounter(initialValue = 0) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);

  const increment = () => setCount((c) => c + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount((c) => c - 1);

  return { count, increment, decrement };
}
```

This is just the beginning of what hooks can do!
