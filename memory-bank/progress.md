- Add basic admin authentication with Supabase Auth

### üéØ Priority 2: Content Management

**Goal**: Admin interface for easy content creation

**Tasks**:

- Simple admin login page
- Form for creating/editing blog posts with Markdown editor
- Image upload integration with Supabase Storage
- Publish/draft functionality

### üîç Priority 3: Search & Discovery

**Goal**: Client-side search across all content

**Tasks**:

- Search component with real-time filtering
- Search across titles, excerpts, tags, and content
- Search results highlighting
- Tag-based filtering system

| **Theme System**      | ‚úÖ Complete    | Light/dark mode smooth        |
| **Database Backend**  | ‚ùå Not Started | **Next priority**             |
| **Admin Interface**   | ‚ùå Not Started | Needs Supabase first          |
| **Search Function**   | ‚ùå Not Started | Client-side implementation    |
| **Image Upload**      | ‚ùå Not Started | Supabase Storage integration  |

## Technical Debt Status

### ‚úÖ Resolved

- CSS organization and naming conventions
- Component duplication and reuse
- Unused imports and files cleanup
- Mobile responsive issues

### üìã None Currently

The codebase is clean with no significant technical debt. The architecture is well-organized and ready for the next phase of development.

## Known Issues

### ‚ùå None Critical

All major issues have been resolved. The application functions well in its current state with static data.

## Evolution of Decisions

### **Content Management Evolution**

- **Started**: Hard-coded HTML content
- **Improved**: Static TypeScript data files with service abstraction
- **Next**: Supabase PostgreSQL with admin interface

### **Component Architecture Evolution**

- **Started**: Multiple card components with duplicate code
- **Current**: Single ContentCard component with props-based customization
- **Result**: Consistent styling and easier maintenance

### **CSS Architecture Evolution**

- **Started**: Unorganized CSS with duplicates
- **Current**: Well-structured vanilla CSS with logical sections
- **Result**: Maintainable styles with no framework dependencies

## Next Sprint Goals

1. **Week 1**: Supabase setup and database schema creation
2. **Week 2**: Data migration and SupabaseContentService implementation
3. **Week 3**: Basic admin interface for content management
4. **Week 4**: Search functionality and image upload system

## Success Criteria

### Database Migration Success

- Content service switches from static files to Supabase seamlessly
- All existing functionality continues to work
- Admin can create posts without editing TypeScript files

### Performance Maintenance

- Page load times remain under 2 seconds
- Mobile experience stays smooth
- Lighthouse scores maintain 90+ across categories

### Developer Experience

- Content creation time reduces from manual file editing to < 5 minutes
- Zero technical debt introduced during migration
- Clean, maintainable codebase preserved
