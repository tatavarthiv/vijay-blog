- ✅ Component architecture and folder structure
- ✅ Theme context with light/dark mode toggle
- ✅ System preference detection for theme with local storage persistence
- ✅ Content service abstraction for data fetching
- ✅ Static TypeScript data for blog posts
- ✅ Static TypeScript data for project content
- ✅ React Router setup with nested routes
- ✅ Main layout with header and footer
- ✅ Home page with recent blog posts
- ✅ Blog listing page with all posts
- ✅ Individual blog post page with content display
- ✅ Projects page with 2-1-2 grid layout matching Figma design
- ✅ Generic ContentCard component for reuse across blog and projects pages
- ✅ About page with skills and information
- ✅ Newsletter page placeholder
- ✅ Responsive design for different screen sizes

## What's Left to Build

### Immediate Next Tasks

- [ ] Improve content formatting and styling
- [ ] Add loading indicators for data fetching operations
- [ ] Enhance responsive design for mobile devices
- [ ] Implement pagination for project page

### Short-Term Goals

- [ ] Implement code syntax highlighting for blog posts
- [ ] Add more interactive UI elements
- [ ] Create detailed project view page
- [ ] Add filtering by project tags

### Medium-Term Goals

- [ ] Implement search functionality
- [ ] Add comments section for blog posts
- [ ] Create working newsletter subscription functionality
- [ ] Set up analytics tracking

### Backlog

- [ ] Social media sharing
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Admin dashboard for content management
- [ ] SEO optimization

## Implementation Details

- **Theme System**: Implemented with React Context and localStorage persistence
- **Content Management**: Moved from Markdown files to static TypeScript data approach for both blog posts and projects
- **Routing**: React Router v6 with nested routes and consistent layout
- **Component Structure**: Clean separation of concerns with focused components, reusable ContentCard component
- **State Management**: Context API for global state, component state for local
- **Grid Layouts**: Specific layouts for blog (special layout for recent posts) and projects (2-1-2 grid)

## Known Issues

- Newsletter functionality is just a placeholder (no backend implementation)
- Static content approach requires rebuild and deployment for content updates
- No search functionality implemented yet
- Mobile navigation could be improved for better UX

## Technical Debt / Refactoring Needs

- CSS organization could be improved with more consistent naming conventions
- Type definition duplication could be reduced in some areas
- Unit tests should be added for components and services
- Markdown utils remain but are not actively used since moving to static data

## Performance Metrics

- Initial page load: ~2 seconds on average connection
- First contentful paint: ~1 second
- Bundle size: To be measured
- Lighthouse score: To be measured after deployment
