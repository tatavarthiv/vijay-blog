# Progress: Personal Blog

## Current Status

**Phase**: Planning & Initial Setup

**Overall Progress**: Early stages - requirements gathered, architecture planned

## What Works

- Project foundation exists with Vite, React, and TypeScript
- Memory bank documentation established
- Design mockup from Figma provides clear visual direction
- Project requirements and architecture defined

## What's Left to Build

### Immediate Next Tasks

- [ ] Set up folder structure based on the technical plan
- [ ] Install required dependencies (React Router, React Markdown, etc.)
- [ ] Create theme context and toggle functionality
- [ ] Implement basic layout components based on the design

### Short-Term Goals

- [ ] Header component with navigation
- [ ] Homepage with blog post listing
- [ ] Individual blog post page with Markdown rendering
- [ ] Light/dark theme implementation

### Medium-Term Goals

- [ ] Projects page and project cards
- [ ] About page
- [ ] Pagination for blog posts
- [ ] Responsive styling for all screen sizes

### Backlog

- [ ] Comments section
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Social media sharing
- [ ] Analytics integration
- [ ] Newsletter subscription

## Implementation Approach

- **Educational Focus**: Each implementation step will include explanations of React/TypeScript concepts
- **Small, Incremental Changes**: Building one component at a time with detailed explanations
- **Self-Documenting Code**: Using descriptive naming patterns with minimal comments
- **Clean Code Style**: No single-line comments; docstrings only for complex logic
- **Explanations Outside Code**: Detailed explanations provided in task completion messages
- **Frequent UI Testing**: Visual feedback after each significant change
- **Simplified Implementations**: Starting with basic patterns before introducing complexity

## Known Issues

- None yet (project in planning phase)
