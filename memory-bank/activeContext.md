# Active Context: Personal Blog

## Current Work Focus

- Implemented generic ContentCard component for both blog and project pages
- Refactored project page to match Figma design with 2-1-2 grid layout
- Created consistent card styling across the site
- Added 5 sample projects with detailed data

## Recent Decisions

- Successfully moved from Markdown files to static TypeScript data approach
- Created reusable ContentCard component to standardize UI elements across blog and project pages
- Implemented React Context for both theme management and content service abstraction
- Updated content service to work with static project data
- Established a clean routing structure with React Router v6
- Implemented responsive design based on the Figma mockup

## Next Steps

1. **Project Page Enhancements**

   - Implement pagination similar to blog page
   - Add filtering by project tags
   - Add detailed project view page

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- **Component Reusability**: Use generic components like ContentCard across different page types
- **Component Organization**: Maintain the current pattern of separating components by feature and function
- **State Management**: Continue using React Context for global state, component state for local
- **Styling**: Use CSS Modules for component-specific styling
- **TypeScript Usage**: Maintain strict typing for all components and functions
- **Code Structure**: Keep the current clean structure with clear separation of concerns
- **Content Services**: Adhere to the interface-based design for potential future database integration
- **Grid Layouts**: Follow the specific grid layout patterns (e.g., 2-1-2 for projects, special layout for recent blog posts)

## Developer Context

- The UI implementation is being updated to more closely match the Figma design
- Theme toggle functionality works with both system preference detection and manual override
- Content service abstraction provides flexibility for future data source changes
- React Router is used for navigation with nested routes and a consistent layout
- Blog posts and projects are currently stored as static data in TypeScript files
- Generic ContentCard component provides consistent UI for both blog posts and projects

## Learnings and Insights

- The static data approach for both blog posts and projects has proven simpler to work with than parsing files
- Component reuse across different page types improves consistency and reduces code duplication
- React Context provides a clean way to manage global state like theme and content service
- The interface-based design for the content service facilitates potential future changes
- Responsive design works well across device sizes
- The component architecture established allows for easy extension and modification

## Current Challenges

- Newsletter functionality still needs backend implementation
- Comments section requires backend support or integration with a third-party service
- Search functionality needs to be implemented for better content discovery
- Analytics integration is pending for tracking user engagement
